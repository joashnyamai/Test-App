# QA Report Form Rate Automation - Implementation Plan

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Add calculateRates function to automatically compute executionRate, passRate, and failRate
2. [x] Modify test case execution input handlers to trigger rate calculations
3. [x] Update form to display rates as calculated values (read-only)
4. [x] Add proper error handling for division by zero scenarios
5. [ ] Test the functionality

## Current Progress:
- All core functionality implemented
- Ready for testing
