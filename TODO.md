# Login Redirect Fix - Implementation Steps

## Steps to Complete:
1. [x] Fix Login.tsx handler to properly handle backend response and redirect
2. [x] Update user store to work with backend authentication
3. [ ] Test the login functionality and redirect

## Current Status:
- Login page has enhanced backend response handling
- User store now uses backend API for authentication instead of local storage
- Both components work with the same backend endpoint

## Completed:
- Enhanced login handler to better handle backend response formats
- Added support for multiple token field names (token, accessToken, access_token, data.token)
- Added user data storage in localStorage
- Improved error handling with specific error messages from backend
- Updated user store interface to support async login operations
- Modified user store login method to use backend API
